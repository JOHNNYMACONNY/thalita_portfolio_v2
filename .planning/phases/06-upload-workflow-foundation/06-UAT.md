# Phase 06 UAT

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Pending Approval
**Phase:** 06-upload-workflow-foundation

## Scope

Verify that:

- the new Studio upload flow supports multi-image intake in one session
- new uploads can land safely in `Unassigned`
- unassigned photos can be batch-assigned into a category slot
- uncategorized uploads stay off the public site
- the workflow language is understandable for a non-technical editor

## Automated Verification Completed

### Build and lint

- `npm run lint -- sanity/schemaTypes/documents/galleryItem.ts sanity/lib/queries.ts sanity/structure.ts sanity.config.ts sanity/photoUploadTool.tsx sanity/components/PhotoUploadTool.tsx` — passed
- `npm run lint -- sanity/components/PhotoOrganizerTool.tsx sanity/components/PhotoUploadTool.tsx sanity/schemaTypes/documents/galleryItem.ts sanity.config.ts sanity/organizePhotosTool.tsx` — passed
- `npm run lint` — passed with one pre-existing warning in `app/about/page.tsx` for an unused `content` variable
- `npm run build` — passed
